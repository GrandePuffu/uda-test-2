# Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Course - 2nd assignment

This is the first assignment for the Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Course

## Getting Started


1. Fork and clone the server repository https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2 then run "node server"
From the command line
2. Run "npm i"
3. Run "gulp build"
4. You can either use Chrome Server plugin and navigate to localhost:8000/build or run "gulp serve" and navigate to localhost:3000/build
Please remember to switch to the "build" folder


## Deployment

This project wants to meet the following criteria:
- The client application should pull restaurant data from the development server, parse the JSON response, and use the information to render the appropriate sections of the application UI.
- The client application works offline. JSON responses are cached using the IndexedDB API. Any data previously accessed while connected is reachable while offline.
- The application maintains a responsive design on mobile, tablet and desktop viewports.
- The application retains accessibility features from the Stage 1 project. Images have alternate text, the application uses appropriate focus management for navigation, and semantic elements and ARIA attributes are used correctly.
- Lighthouse targets for each category exceed:
Progressive Web App: >90
Performance: >70
Accessibility: >90
