# Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Course - 1st assignment

This is the first assignment for the Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Course

## Getting Started

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 
Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use 
`python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`


## Deployment

This project wants to meet the following criteria:
- Create a responsive web design (using media queries)
- Create an accessible site (using aria roles, alt tags and other accessibility tools)
- Use a ServiceWorker to serve contents offline
